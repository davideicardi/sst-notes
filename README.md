## Helpers

### Create a test user and get credentials for API

Weâ€™ll use AWS CLI to sign up a user with their email and password.

```bash
./helpers/create-cognito-user
```
(fill Region and UserPoolClientId with the ones printed by sst outputs)

Confirm user.

```bash
./helpers/verify-cognito-user-email
```
(fill Region and UserPoolId with the ones printed by sst outputs)

Generate credentials for API:

```
./create-cognito-credentials.js
```
(fill all requested parameters)

Postman can be used to generate AWS signature using a specified auth kind passing the output of the above commands.
